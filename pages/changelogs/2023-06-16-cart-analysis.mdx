For ecommerce companies, understanding the purchase behavior of your users is vital when creating any revenue-driving strategy — whether that’s through website changes, marketing tactics, or product offerings. 
That’s why we built Cart Analysis to allow you to surface details about the items in your user’s cart (brand, category, price, etc) at different moments in their purchase journey (viewed product, added to cart, purchased). This is made possible by being able to look at any sub-property within a list-of-objects data type.

An example question you can ask in Mixpanel with the power of Cart Analysis might be “how many cart checkouts with a total of over $100 have a sneaker product as an item?”

There are a few key features we’re using within Cart Analysis to create this visualization:

- **“Sum” computed property**: this prompts a selection of a numeric property contained within the objects of the list, and in this case, we summed the price of the items within the cart
- **“Or any” operator**: this distinguishes the relationship between two filters, and in this case, we’re filtering carts by whether their total price is over $75 and if they have any number of sneakers
Getting the answer to this question can help inform a product offering strategy, like if you wanted to consider offering discounts or incentives for customers who purchase sneakers along with other products to encourage cart values over $75.
